-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A multithreaded vanity account generating tool for the Ripple p2p network.

Requires Boost and OpenSSL.

TODO:
    - Validate patterns correctly, make sure the user doesn't end
      up waiting forever for a pattern that will never occur.

    - Make it easier to plug in different alphabets and rules.

    - Remove unused portions of source code.

    - Improve performance by removing unnecessary branching,
      excessive calls, unnecessary memory allocations and copies,
      and replacing the elliptic curve library with something faster.

    - Allow user to specify the seed and then search accounts for that
      seed (right now uses a hardcoded index of 0 for each seed).

    - The search space is sufficiently ample so that it is highly
      unlikely that two threads will end up overlapping in their
      search range, or that running the program multiple times with
      the same pattern will result in an overlap. But it's very cheap
      to guarantee this won't happen. Moreover, the user could be
      allowed to provide an initial search value either directly or as a
      passphrase hash (although this can compromise security).

    - Support for wider pattern formats. Wildcards, ranges, or even
      regexes.

    - Support for coordinated searches across many machines.
